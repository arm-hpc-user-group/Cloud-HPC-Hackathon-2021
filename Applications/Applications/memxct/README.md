# MemXCT

**Description:** 
MemXCT is an accelerated implementation of X-ray compute tomography application. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) is used regularly at synchrotron light sources to study the internal morphology of materials at high resolution. However, experimental constraints, such as radiation sensitivity, can result in noisy or undersampled measurements. Further, depending on the resolution, sample size and data acquisition rates, the resulting noisy dataset can be terabyte-scale. Advanced iterative reconstruction techniques can produce high-quality images from noisy measurements, but their computational requirements have made their use exception rather than the rule. MemXCT proposed a novel memory-centric approach that avoids redundant computations at the expense of additional memory complexity. Fundamentally, MemXCT uses an optimized SpMV implementation with two-level pseudo-Hilbert ordering and multi-stage input buffering. In this code base, we provide complete implementation of the MemXCT kernel along with the associated dataset that is required to generate resulting data for x86, powerr9 and ARM systems.

## Compilation

Currently we dont support Spack package. Building is simple: 

```
make -f Makefile.<platform>
bash run.sh.<platform>
```
