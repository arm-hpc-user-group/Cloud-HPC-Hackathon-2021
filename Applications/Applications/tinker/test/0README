                     TEST Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains some test casess illustrating use of several
      of the programs in the Tinker package.

      For example, the argon.run file contains commands to run the first
      test case. The resulting output is found in the file argon.log.

      The clean.make script will remove any output files generated during
      the example runs and should be invoked prior to validating Tinker
      executables against the provided log files.

      (1) ANION       estimates the free energy of hydration of Cl- anion
                      vs. Br- anion via a 2 picosecond simulation on a
                      "hybrid" anion in a box of water, followed by free
                      energy perturbation

      (2) ARGON       minimize, then perform 25 picoseconds of molecular
                      dynamics simulation, on a box with 150 argon atoms

                      cluster of 13 argon atoms to find the global minimum

      (4) CRAMBIN     generate a Tinker XYZ file from a PDB file, followed

                      algorithm; vibrational analysis of the results shows
                      the same TS with one negative frequency

      (8) ENKEPHALIN  generate coordinates from amino acid sequence and
                      phi/psi angles, followed by energy minimization and

      (9) ETHANOL     fit torsional parameter values for the C-C-O-H bond
                      based on relative quantum mechanical (G09) energies

      (10) FORMAMIDE  generate a unit cell from fractional coordinates,
                      followed by full crystal energy minimization and

                      mode using a sliding block iterative diagonalization
                      (alter gpcr.run script to save the file gpcr.001 if
                      you want to view the mode; this example can require
                      up to an hour to complete)

                      to extract coordinates and permanent multipoles, set
                      local frames and polarization groups, modify the
                      intramolecular polarization, and average equivalent
                      atomic sites

      (17) NITROGEN   calculate the self-diffusion constant and N-N radial
